# SimpleCalc
Simple calculator I built in C#.  Built with .NET 5.  This Project is now my final project for SD 1 / Code Louisville.  

This is just as the name says, it is a Simple Calculator.  It will only at this moment will do simple arithmatic.  (add, subtract, multiply, devide) It will only take two numbers at the moment.  

It will ask you for the the first number, and then the second number and ask how you would like to process the numbers.  

## Things to work on:
```
Work on adding Checks for numbers after they have been entered.
Work on breaking in Methods and Classes if able to.
```
